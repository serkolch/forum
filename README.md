# NYC Pick-Up Sports Forum

## Description
This forum should serve as a resource for anyone in NYC who's ever had to try and organize fun sporting events with their friends - you might not have enough for pick-up basketball in Rucker Park, you might be looking for a tennis partner at the Billie Jean King Center, or you might be trying to join a game of touch football in East River Park.

A user can choose a sport/forum, and view a list of topics (default will order the most recent topics at the top). Opening the topic brings up any comments users have posted to that comment. If there aren't any suitable topics, a user can create a new topic.
