# NYC Pick-Up Sports Forum

## Description
This forum should serve as a resource for anyone in NYC who's ever had to try and organize fun sporting events with their friends - you might not have enough for pick-up basketball in Rucker Park, you might be looking for a tennis partner at the Billie Jean King Center, or you might be trying to join a game of touch football in East River Park.

There is one forum with all topics. Opening a topic brings up the content of the topic and comments users have posted to that comment. If there aren't any suitable topics, a user can create a new topic.

By default, topics will be ordered in reverse chronological order due to the nature of this forum - users want to find quick spontaneous pick-up games as opposed to partake in lengthy conversations. However, users will be able to re-arrange the topics by number of comments or likes so that they can partake in popular events.
